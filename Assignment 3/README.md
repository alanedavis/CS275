## How to run my code
Be sure to unzip the file so that you have all of the documents in the same folder.

**Should Contain**:
1. aed84_HW2.html (file)
1. calc.js (file)
1. styles.css (file)
1. package.json (file)

</br>In the command terminal run the commands `npm install express` and `node calc.js`.
