            The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numebers that is created starting with "0, 1".
            The rest of the sequence is made by adding the two preceding numbers infinitely. The Fibonacci
            Sequence is a math phenomenon that has been around for decades as it can be represented in
            multiple facscinating ways.
